# (Python based) Easy Representation of Knowledge (pyERK)

- Currently in pre-alpha-phase
- Inspired by OWL, but more expressive
- Inspired by Wikidata, but much simpler
- Inspired by SUO-KIF, but with less brackets
- Represented directly in python
- Designed to formally represent knowledge (including meta levels)
